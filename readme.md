## About

This repo tracks short Python projects completed each day. The goal is consistent practice: small programs, readable code, and incremental learning.

## How to run

Each day typically contains a small script or notebook. To run a day's script:

- Install Python 3.8+ if needed.
- From this folder run: `python3 day/ 1/brand-name-generator.py`
