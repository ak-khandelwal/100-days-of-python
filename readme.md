## About

This repo tracks short Python projects completed each day. The goal is consistent practice: small programs, readable code, and incremental learning.

## How to run

Each day typically contains a small script or notebook. To run a day's script:

- Install Python 3.8+ if needed.
- From this folder run: `python3 day/ 1/brand-name-generator.py`

## Projects (Days)

1. **Day 1** - Brand name generator  
   A tiny script that combines words to generate brand name ideas.
2. **Day 2** - Tip Calculator  
   Simple CLI to split a bill and calculate tips.
3. **Day 3** - Treasure Hunt  
   A text-based choice game that practices control flow and input handling.
4. **Day 4** - Rock Paper Scissors  
   Classic game versus the computer, practicing randomization and logic.
